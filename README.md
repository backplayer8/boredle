## A small collection of tools to help solve the daily puzzle by [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/ "Guess the Wordle in 6 tries")

This started off as just a few functions that I wrote in order to finally succeed at a word game. At this stage of the script I have been running this in repl though it's at a point it can be scripted easily enough. It still has a ways to go and I'm sure tons of room for improvement but it has been a fun little project. I welcome feedback/pull requests.
