## A small collection of tools to help solve the daily puzzle by [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/ "Guess the Wordle in 6 tries")

![3/6 Guesses required to solve!](resources/IMG_3120.jpg "First solve in 3 guesses.")
![5/5 Puzzles Attempted/Solved](resources/IMG_3119.jpg "5/5 Puzzles Attempted/Solved!")

This is a small collection of a few functions that I wrote in order to finally succeed at a word game. At this time these functions are standalone and have no defined order or flow. At its inception, these functions are all being ran from REPL as I progress. The  My goal for this repo is to take it from a few standalone functions that are ran in a semi-random order to a structured tool, optemized to give the best possible chance of solving the puzzle in as few turns as possible. I welcome any feedback or PR, this is my first public repo, please be gentle, or don't, I'm not your momma. If you've read this far, thanks for your time and I hope at least one other person finds this repo helpful.
